// Depreciation refers to the decrease of price of a product/asset over time. As we know every product/asset has its own life span. So, during itâ€™s life span with the pass of time its value reduces due to use, wear and tear.
// formula to calculate depreciation is: V2 = V1[1-r/100] ^ t
// where V1 is the value at a certain time and r% per annum is the rate(the rate cannot be more than 100%) of depreciation per year and T denotes the number of years.
