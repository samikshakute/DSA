What is the time complexity of the following code :

    int a = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (j = N; j > i; j--) {
            a = a + i + j;
        }
    }

--> Time complexity: N*N
    Space complexity: O(1)

Q) What does it mean when we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y?
--> X will always be better choice for large inputs
